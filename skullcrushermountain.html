        W{E}elcome to my secret l{E:sus4:}air on Skullcrusher M{E}ountain. {E:sus4:}
        I h{E}ope that you've enjoyed your st{E:sus4:}ay so far? 
        I see you've m{E:7:}et my assistant Scarface.
        His app{A}earance is quite dist{E}urbing, 
        but I ass{A}ure you he's harmless en{B:7:}ough.
        He's a sw{A}eetheart, calls me m{E}aster, 
        and he has a w{A}ay of f{B:7:}inding pr{A}etty th{B:7:}ings 
        And br{A}inging them to m{B:7:}e...

        Oh, and I{E}'m so into you, but I'm {Bm}way too smart for you.
        Even my h{A}enchmen think I'm crazy; I'm not surp{Am}rised that you agree.
        If you could f{E}ind some way to be a little bit l{Bm}ess afraid of me,
        You'd see the v{A}oices that control me from in{Am}side my head
        Say {D:7:}I shouldn't kill you, y{E}et.

        I made this half-pony, half-monkey monster to please you,
        But I get the feeling that you don't like it.
        What's with all the screaming?
        You like monkeys; you like ponies...
        Maybe you don't like monsters so much?
        Maybe I used too many monkeys...
        Isn't it enough to know that I ruined a pony making a gift for you?

        Oh, and I'm so into you, but I'm way too smart for you.
        Even my henchmen think I'm crazy; I'm not surprised that you agree.
        If you could find some way to be a little bit less afraid of me,
        You'd see the voices that control me from inside my head
        Say I shouldn't kill you, yet.

        Picture the t{A}wo of us {(F#m)}alone inside my g{G#m}olden subm{(C#m)}arine,

        You know it isn't easy living here on Skullcrusher Mountain.
        Maybe you could cut me just a little slack &mdash;
        Would it kill you to be civil?
        I've been patient, I've been gracious,
        And this mountain is covered with wolves &mdash;
        Hear them howling, my hungry children.
        Maybe you should stay and have another drink 
        and think about me and you?
