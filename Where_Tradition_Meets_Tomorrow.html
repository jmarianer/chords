        I'll see her standing by the monorail

        I'll say I'm sorry, she'll say it's not your fault
        Or is it?
        And she eyes me suspiciously
        Hearing the whir of the servos inside
        She will scream and try to run
        But there's nowhere she can hide
        When a crazy cyborg wants to make you his robot bride
