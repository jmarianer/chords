        But I {G}know that I'll for{A}get the look of {G}pity in her {A}face

        I'll probably be some kind of scientist
        Building inventions in my space lab in space
        I'll end world hunger I'll make dolphins speak
        Work through the daytime, spend my nights and weekends
        Perfecting my warrior robot race
        Building them one laser gun at a time
        I will do my best to teach them
        About life and what it's worth
        I just hope that I can keep them from destroying the Earth

        I'll see her standing by the monorail
        She'll look the same except for bionic eyes
        She lost the real ones in the robot wars
        I'll say I'm sorry, she'll say it's not your fault
        Or is it?
        And she eyes me suspiciously
        Hearing the whir of the servos inside
        She will scream and try to run
        But there's nowhere she can hide
        When a crazy cyborg wants to make you his robot bride

        I made this half-pony, half-monkey monster to please you,
        But I get the feeling that you don't like it.
        What's with all the screaming?
        You like monkeys; you like ponies...
        Maybe you don't like monsters so much?
        Maybe I used too many monkeys...
        Isn't it enough to know that I ruined a pony making a gift for you?

        You know it isn't easy living here on Skullcrusher Mountain.
